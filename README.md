# Getting Started with the Mini Palomar React app

- Navigate to the project directory and perform an `npm install`. 
- Start the React app using `npm run start`. This should pop open a development version of the app in your browser under http://localhost:3002/
- From here, you should be able to see the listing of companies with their details. There's a simple search input near the top since 100 items is somewhat of a large lift to gather useful data on. 

## Caveats
There are some obvious things that are missing, such as
- There's not much in the way of useful error handling for the user, but would be ironed out if I had more time. 
- Testing to check if json properties or values are missing.
